# AgriEval: A Comprehensive Chinese Agricultural Benchmark for Large Language Models

In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) \textit{Comprehensive Capability Evaluation.} AgriEval covers 6 major agriculture categories and 41 subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenariosâ€”memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) \textit{High-Quality Data.} The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments, providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) \textit{Diverse Formats and Extensive Scale.} AgriEval comprises 20,634 choice questions and 2,104 open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive experimental results over 45 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60\% accuracy, underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model performance and propose strategies for enhancement.
